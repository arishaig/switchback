# Pre-Selected Logos

This directory contains pre-selected logos that can be used with Switchback's generated wallpaper mode.

## Available Logos

- **archlinux.svg** - Official Arch Linux logo

## Using These Logos

When configuring generated wallpapers in the GUI:

1. Go to the "Generated" tab
2. Click "Choose..." next to Logo
3. Navigate to this directory (typically `/usr/share/switchback/logos` or in the source directory)
4. Select a logo file

The logos will be tinted with your chosen colors and overlaid on solid color backgrounds to create dynamic wallpapers.

## Adding Your Own Logos

You can add your own PNG or SVG logos to use with Switchback. For best quality:

- **SVG files** are recommended (vector graphics scale perfectly)
- **PNG files** should be high resolution (at least 2000x2000 pixels)
- Logo should have transparency (alpha channel) for best results
- Simple, bold designs work best
